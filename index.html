                            <p class="intro">Hi, I'm Steven Miller!</p>
                            <p>I'm a 28 year old aspiring Web Developer who also works as a barista at Starbucks Coffee Company in San Diego, California.
                                Although I have spent much of my adult life working in the food and retail industry, I have since been inspired to pursue 
                                a career in programming. Through my studies at Thinkful, I hope to realize my dream to become a part of a team of passionate
                                developers and create meaningful works that may one day make the lives of others easier.
                            </p>
                            <p>Part of what I hope to accomplish by pursuing Web Development is to teach and inspire others. Throughout my studies there were 
                                many teachers and professors that took a huge role in shaping who I am today. From the way they taught, to the life lessons 
                                they shared, I very much wish to return this love for teaching every chance I get. In my time at Starbucks I have trained over
                                thirty five partners, and by growing a small community on twitch.tv, I have a chance to share my knowledge and showcase my skills
                                in things I am very passionate about. I want to give back to the community that has helped me countless times over the years.
                            </p>

                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <div class="group">
                        <div class="item item-double">
                            <p>A large part of my decision and drive to become a Web Developer comes from the realization that I truly enjoy the methodical thought 
                                process of conceiving a solution to problems others might have. I know that over time, as my knowledge of languages grow, I will have
                                more tools at my disposal to translate desire into functionality. Ultimately, I hope that one day I may learn from and work with a team
                                of like-minded programmers to create a platform that can be a safe place to teach and guide others in their journey of self improvement 
                                as well. Life is rough for so many of us, and any chance that I may have to lift someone from that darkness is not one I would ever pass up. 
                            </p>
                            <p>As I mentioned previously, one of my biggest passions is playing video games. I have many memories of Saturday afternoons with my parents 
                                and younger brother playing World of Warcraft together. Whenever my dad would buy a new game, I would spend all day sitting next to him just
                                watching him take on the biggest bosses and craziest puzzles. In this, I found a love for playing games and streaming. For years I wanted to 
                                start a stream of my own on twitch.tv so that I could entertain others in the same way I was grossly entertained growing up. Combining this 
                                with my passion for teaching, I have found a niche of informative, yet exciting gameplay in hopes of recreating that moment of awe with others.
                            </p>
                            <p>As my career in Web Development is getting started, I can currently utilize the following languages:</p>
